CODE FOR COMBO PART (io haven't implemented it but i was asking gpt and it gave me it has a bonus point so i am adding it here)
var combo_count = 0
var last_slice_time = 0.0
var combo_timer = 2.0  # Time within which combos are counted

func _on_fruit_sliced():
    var current_time = OS.get_ticks_msec() / 1000.0
    if current_time - last_slice_time < combo_timer:
        combo_count += 1
        score += 10 * combo_count  # Bonus for combos
    else:
        combo_count = 1  # Reset combo
        score += 10
    last_slice_time = current_time
    $ScoreLabel.text = "Score: %d" % score
